## Features 

### Material-UI 

The web app is built using [Material UI Components](https://material-ui.com/). I used them as they have lots of built-in customizable components and I'm familiar with the library.

### Search Movie in Real-time :arrow_forward:

You can search your movies in realtime. Just visit here and start searching for your favorite movie. This makes it easier for user to browse movies without having to press "Enter" button, which can be annoying for the user sometimes.

### Movie List Pagination :1234:

Since there are 581 movies:exclamation: for the word "fast" and lot more for others, I thought its better to have pages that user can browse through instead of a long list of movies.

### View Movie Cast and Crew :couple:

One of the important determining factors for nominating movies is the "Cast & Crew" of the movie. For solving this, I have a "View Cast" button which redirects the user to IMDB page with list of all the actors in the movie.

### Nomination List :inbox_tray:

See a movie you like? You can add it to your list by clicking the "Nominate" button on each movie.

### Remove from Nomination List :exclamation:

Did you add the wrong movie to your list? :x:  You can remove the movie from you list by clicking the "trash" icon near in the list item. But wait... do you want to discard the current list and add make a new one? Use the "trash" icon on top of the list to start fresh :repeat:

### Shareable link :paperclip:

Share your nomination list with your friends today! Just click the "link" icon in your nomination list and a link will be copied to your clipboard.

## Future Release Ideas :scroll:

We could add a lot of features in the future to improve the user experience and usage of the platform. 
- Display more data in the cards like "rating" of the movie which is a very crucial aspect in choosing a movie. 
- Filters to search movies (like "New releases", "Oldest", "Sort by release year", "Search with a specific movie actor", sort by other aspects of the movie, etc.)
- API Request Cancellation can also be added so we can cancel the previous requests when user keeps on typing. This could be a very important feature when we want to scale the application and support lots of users.
- Store versions of the Nominations list or different types of nominations list for different movie genre.
